##Kombucha US Sales
Newsweek reports that between 2008 and 2009, [US kombucha sales quadrupled, from USD 80 million to USD 324 million](http://books.google.be/books?id=TjXEAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA167&ots=DYejw8U92q&dq=quadrupled%20sales%20kombucha&hl=nl&pg=PA167#v=snippet&q=sales%20quadrupled,%20from%20$80%20million%20to%20$324%20million.&f=false).

Data from [SPINS](http://www.spins.com) are slightly different but based on actuall scanning data at stores across the US. Although they present data which does not include all retailers, the chart shows a similar trend with a projected sales volume of **$500** million in **2015**.
