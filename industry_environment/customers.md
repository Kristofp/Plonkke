It's safe to say that the reduction in consumption can be largely attributed to the economic downturn. **The countries** with the **largest GDP growth rate differences** also happen to be those with the **steepest decline** in softdrink sales.

Another remarkable trend is the **rise of low-calorie drinks** which seems to indicate the consumers are more aware of the health consequences of large intake of sugar.

Over a period of 13 years we can see a 25.9% increase and for low-calorie drinks 123.4%!

Looking at these data we conclude there is **still growth in Belgium** and our direct neigboring countries which is **possitive**.

There is **more health awareness** which is also positive since a healthier softdrink alternative is one of our objectives.
