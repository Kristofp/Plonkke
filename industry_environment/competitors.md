Kombucha is relatively unknown on the Belgian market. There are only 2 producers on the market and one of those producers has a few white label brands.

However their approach is totally different as they are focused on the beneficial probiotics rather than on offering a healthy alternative for soft drinks.

As a result their current marketing and their products taste perception is far different from what we have in mind.
