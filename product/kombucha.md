# Kombucha

Kombucha is a living health drink made by fermenting tea and sugar with the kombucha culture. The result can taste like something between sparkling apple cider and champagne, depending on what kind of tea you use. It's not what you'd imagine fermented tea to taste like.

##History

The origins of Kombucha have become lost in the mists of time. It is thought to have originated in the Far East, probably China, and has been consumed there for at least two thousand years. The first recorded use of kombucha comes from China in 221 BC during the Tsin Dynasty. It was known as "The Tea of Immortality".

It has been used in Eastern Europe, Russia and Japan for several centuries. It's from Japan in 415 AD that the name kombucha is said to have come. A Korean physician called Kombu or Kambu treated the Emperor Inyko with the tea and it took his name, "Kombu" and "cha" meaning tea. Russia has a long tradition of using a healing drink called "Tea Kvass" made from a "Japanese Mushroom".

From Russia it spread to Prussia, Poland, Germany and Denmark but it seems to have died out during World War II. After the war Dr Rudolph Skelnar created renewed interest in kombucha in Germany when he used it in his practice to treat cancer patients, metabolic disorders, high blood pressure and diabetes.

##The Kombucha Fermentation Process

Kombucha tea is made by fermenting sweetened black tea with a flat, pancake-like culture of yeasts and bacteria called the "Kombucha mushroom" or "scoby" which stands for ' symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeasts. It is not actually a mushroom, but is called one because of the shape and color of the sac that forms on top of the tea after it ferments.

The culture used in Kombucha tea varies, but consists of several species of yeast and bacteria. It may include:

###Yeast

* Saccharomycodes ludwigii
* Saccharomycodes apiculatus
* Schizosaccharomyces pombe
* Zygosaccharomyces kombuchaensis
* Zygosaccharomyces bailii
* Saccharomyces cerevisiae
* Saccharomyces boulardi
* Brettanomyces bruxellensis
* Candida stellata
* Candida krusei
* Candida kefyr
* Candida utilis
* Torulaspora delbrueckii
* Hanseniaspora kloeckera
* Issatchenkia orientalis
* Pichia fermentans

###Bacteria

* Acetobacter xylinum,
* Acetobacter gluconicum
* Acetobacter xylinoides
* Gluconacetobacter kombuchae
* Lactobacillus pediococcus
* Acetobacter ketogenum


As the Kombucha culture digests the sugar it produces a range of organic acids like glucuronic acid, gluconic acid, lactic acid, acetic acid, butyric acid, malic acid and usnic acid; vitamins, trace amounts of B vitamins and vitamin C; as well as amino acids, enzymes. And of course there are all the benefits of the probiotic microorganisms themselves. The Kombucha culture is a biochemical powerhouse.

##The Organic Acids

* Acetic acid
* Acetoacetic acid
* Benzoic acid
* propenyl ester
* Benzonitrile
* Butanoic acid
* Caffeine
* Citric acid
* Cyanocobalamin
* Decanoic acid
* Ethyl Acetate
* Lactic Acid
* Fructose
* d-Gluconic acid
* Glucose
* Hexanoic acid
* Itaconic acid
* 2-Keto-gluconic acid
* 5-Keto-gluconic acid
* 2-Keto-3-deoxy-gluconic Lactic acid
* Niacinamide
* Nicotinic acid
* Malic acid
* Pantothenic acid
* Phenethyl Alcohol
* Phenol, 4-ethyl
* 6-Phospho gluconate
* Propionic acid
* Octanoic acid
* Oxalic acid
* Riboflavin
* d-Saccharic acid
* (Glucaric acid)
* Succinic acid
* Thiamin
* Usnic Acid
* plus 40 other acid esters in trace amount.

##Kombucha and Health

Many health claims are made for kombucha but there is less research on the benefits of kombucha than there is on fermented milk products. It has certainly been shown to have similar antibiotic, antiviral and anti fungal properties in lab tests. In rats it’s been shown to protect against stress and improve liver function. There is a lot of experiential evidence from people who have been using kombucha over many years. Many of the benefits reported include improvements in energy levels, metabolic disorders, allergies, cancer, digestive problems, candidiasis, hypertension, HIV, chronic fatigue and arthritis. It ‘s also used externally for skin problems and as a hair wash among other things.

###Glucuronic acid

Although no trace amounts of Glucuronic acid is found Kombucha increases the level of Glucuronic acid in the body. It's the body's most important detoxifier. When toxins enter the liver this acid binds them to it and flushes them out through the kidneys. Once bound by glucuronic acid toxins cannot escape. As a detoxifying agent it's one of the few agents that can cope with pollution from the products of the petroleum industry, including all the plastics, herbicides, pesticides and resins. It kidnaps the phenols in the liver, which are then eliminated easily by the kidneys. Kombucha can be very helpful for allergy sufferers. Another by-product of glucuronic acid are the glucosamines, the structures associated with cartilage, collagen and the fluids which lubricate the joints. It is this function that makes Kombucha so effective against arthritis.

###Lactic Acid
Essential for the digestive system. Assist blood circulation, helps prevent bowel decay and constipation. Aids in balancing acids and alkaline in the body and believed to help in the prevention of cancer by helping to regulate blood pH levels.

###Acetic Acid
A powerful preservative and it inhibits harmful bacteria.

###Usnic Acid
A natural antibiotic that can be effective against many viruses.

###Oxalic Acid
An effective preservative and encourages the intercellular production of energy.

###Malic acid
Helps detoxify the liver.

###Gluconic Acid
Produced by the bacteria, it can break down to caprylic acid is of great benefit to sufferers of candidiasis and other yeast infections such as thrush.

###Butyric acid
Produced by the yeast, protects human cellular membranes and combined with Gluconic acid strengthens the walls of the gut to combat yeast infections like candida.
