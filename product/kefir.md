#Water Kefir or Tibicos
Water kefir is a water–sucrose-based beverage, fermented by a symbiosis of bacteria and yeast to produce a final product that is lightly carbonated, acidic and that has a low alcohol percentage. The microorganisms present in water kefir are introduced via water kefir grains, which consist of a polysaccharide matrix in which the microorganisms are embedded.

Tibicos is also known as tibi, water kefir grains, sugar kefir grains, Japanese water crystals and California bees, and in older literature as bébées, African bees, ale nuts, Australian bees, balm of Gilead, beer seeds, beer plant, bees, ginger bees, Japanese beer seeds and vinegar bees

##History
The exact origin of the Water-Kefir unfortunately is not known. In 1899, M. Lutz documented its existence in the sugar saturated water of the Ountia cactus for the first time. It is to be assumed that the Water-Kefir actually originates from various places. In Europe it has been used since the beginning of the 1930’s. In Switzerland for instance it has been known as “Tibi-kernel” before WW II. In the French speaking regions it was called “graines vivantes” (“living kernel”).

##Fermentation Process
Sequencing-based analysis of the fungal component established that it was comprised of the genera:

* Yeasts
* Dekkera
* Hanseniaspora
* Saccharomyces
* Zygosaccharomyces florentinus
* Torulospora pretoriensis
* Kloeckera apiculata
* Candida lambica
* Candida valida
* Lachancea

Analyses revealed that the bacterial fraction of water kefir and grain was dominated by:

* Bacteria
* Zymomonas
* Lactobacillus casei
* Lactobacillus hilgardii
* Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp.dextranicum
* Streptococcus lactis
* Acetic acid bacteria
