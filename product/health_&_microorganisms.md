#Microorganisms & our health

There is a mass of microorganisms housed in our human shell. **Every person alive** is host to about **100 trillion bacterial cells**. They **outnumber human cells 10 to one** and account for **99.9 percent of the unique genes** in our body.

Our **collection of microbiota**, known as the **microbiome**, is the human equivalent of an environmental ecosystem. Although the bacteria together **weigh a mere three pounds**, their composition determines much about how the body functions and, alas, sometimes malfunctions.

Like ecosystems the world over, the **human microbiome is losing its diversity**, to the potential detriment of the health of those it inhabits.

There is significant evidence that **links** the **declining variety within the microbiome** to our **increased susceptibility to serious, often chronic conditions**,  from **allergies** and **celiac disease** to **Type 1 diabetes** and **obesity**.

Even **a short course of antibiotics** like the widely prescribed  Z-pack (azithromycin, taken for five days), **can result in long-term shifts** in the **bodyâ€™s microbial environment**.

**Kombucha, Kefir** and other **fermented food and beverages** can contribute to a **healthier microbiome** in the human gut.
