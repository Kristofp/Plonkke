#Marketing strategy

##Two product lines:

###Mainstream product

A more accessible product with a more palatable taste that appeals to a broader range of consumers.  This product will be marketed as an alternative for soft-drinks. And will be distributed through a variety of channels

* Biostores
* Supermarkets
* Yoga Centres
* Fitness Centres
* Health Spas

It will be brewed under private label at first until our first goals of market saturation will be achieved.
In a second phase we will invest in a modern brewing facility so we can increase production to accomodate for grewing demand.

###High end product

This product will be a refined fermetented tea made from the finest blend of organic teas, a delicately chosen blend of herbs and spices.

It will be brewed on oak barrels as with wine the flavors of the kombucha combine with the flavors imparted from the barrel, and start getting some of those vanilla, coffee, mocha, butter, or caramel notes depending on the toast regime of the barrel.

This will create a high end Kombucha aimed at restaurants bottled and offered as a healthy non- alcholic alternative to wine.

In a similar way to [Madikombucha](http://www.madikombucha.com/) from Thailand.
