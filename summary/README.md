# Summary


**Plønkke** offers **healthy probiotic beverages** based on Kombucha & Kefir tapping into a growing worldwide interest in healthy foods and superfoods.

**Consumers are more aware** than ever of their own nutritional deficits, and what poor eating and drinking habits can do in terms of their long-term health.

**Soft drinks** are considered to be a major **contributor to the rise of obesity** and the number of people with **diabetes** is reaching epidemic proportions.

Kombucha & Kefir make **excellent probiotic drinks** without the detrimental effects on health by actively supporting digestive processes and adding beneficial probiotics.
Unlike yoghurt it's **completely dairy-free** and with a much broader range of healthy microorganism and favourable by-products.

The process is **similar to making beer, cider and vinegar**, cultures of friendly yeasts and bacteria transform tea into Kombucha or Kefir.

Kombucha is currently the **fastest growing health beverage** in the US in defiance of a weak economic backdrop and super-premium pricing.

Despite it's popularity in the USA the European market for this healthy beverage remains a largely **untapped opportunity**.

**Plønkke** differentiates itself from existing local Kombucha & Kefir Brands, by offering a **naturally flavoured product** that appeals to a **broader range of people** taking it outside the holistic and medicinal realm.

In accordance to the grassroot's origins of the drink **Plønkke** supports the philosophy that we must attend to the needs of the present without sacrificing the ability of future generations by embracing **sustainability**.
